# NITA 22.8

Welcome to NITA 22.8.

NITA is an open source platform for automating the building and testing of complex networks.

# Release Notes

For a list of new features, bug fixes and other release details, please look at the [NITA Webapp README](https://github.com/Juniper/nita-webapp/blob/22.8/README.md#217-new-features-and-bug-fixes).

# History

NITA was developed by a small team of Professional Services consultants at Juniper Networks in 2015 and it has been fed and watered by them ever since. In 2020 it was open sourced and made available on GitHub to allow anyone in the industry to use for free and to contribute to if they wished.

# What Does NITA Do?

As a platform, NITA comprises some of the best Automation tools currently available, such as:

* Ansible, for configuration change management
* Jenkins, for automation and job control
* Robot Framework, for test automation
* Docker, for packaging and easy deployment

In a nutshell, NITA can be used as a toolbox from which you can automate the deployment and testing of very complex networks. It is vendor neutral and so can be used to build and test networks from all of the leading vendors in the market. And because it is a toolbox it can be extended to include any other tool that you may need.

# Examples

If you want to experiment to see what NITA can do, we currently have [3 example projects](https://github.com/Juniper/nita/tree/main/examples) that are provided in this repository:

* [ChatGPT Integration with Robot and Jenkins](https://github.com/Juniper/nita/tree/main/examples/chatgpt).

    Ever needed help investigating why an automated test has failed? This example will send failed test case descriptions to ChatGPT and ask for the top suggestions on how to solve them. All of a sudden, you will look like a genius!

* Build and test an [EVPN VXLAN data centre using Juniper QFX devices](https://github.com/Juniper/nita/tree/main/examples/evpn_vxlan_erb_dc)

    This includes all of the config that you need to build the data centre fabric and VXLAN overlay along with 14 example Robot tests for the firewalls, switches, BGP leaf and spine devices and end IP connectivity.
We show integration with other operational tools for "Day 2 Management", storing inventory in Netbox and having that push changes to the network via the Juniper Paragon Insights product.

* Build and test a [Simple DC WAN topology based on IPCLOS and eBGP](https://github.com/Juniper/nita/tree/main/examples/ebgp_wan)

    This is between 2 example datacentres, with 13 example Robot tests for border leaf routers, DC spines and WAN PE devices, plus BGP and IP connectivity tests.
